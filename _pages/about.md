I am currently a PhD student at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in the [Turbulent Shear Flow Laboratory](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~vnaraya3/), working with Dr. Venkat Narayanaswamy and Dr. Kevin Lyons. I perform experimental research in turbulent combustion, specifically studying autoignition and MILD (Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution) combustion. My research aims to gain a better understanding of turbulence and combustion phenomena that are of great importance in developing the next generation of high efficiency, low emission combustors. I employ non-intrusive laser diagnostic techniques to probe turbulent flames, with a view to understanding the complex interaction of flow turbulence and combustion chemistry.
