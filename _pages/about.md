I am currently a PhD student at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) in the [Turbulent Shear Flow Laboratory](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~vnaraya3/). I perform experimental research in turbulent combustion, specifically studying autoignition and MILD (Moderate or Intense Low-oxygen Dilution) combustion.
